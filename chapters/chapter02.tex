$X$ the payoff (profit) by the
firm in period 1. It is known at $1^{-}$ (the beginning
of period 1) but received at $1^{+}$ (the end of period 1).
We denote $\tilde{X}$ this payoff per dollar 
invested in period 0: $\tilde{X} = \frac{X}{P_0}$.

Assume we have two sources of risk (uncertainty), $\tilde{M}$
a macroeconomic factor and $\tilde{CC}$ a climate risk factor.
These shocks occurs at $1^{-}$.
The unexpected payoff in period 1 is:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \tilde{X} - E_0(\tilde{X}) = \beta_m \tilde{M} + \beta_{cc} \tilde{CC} + \varepsilon_1
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The payoff is known at $1^{-}$, so 
we can comput the price of the stock:

\begin{equation}
    \tilde{P_1} = \beta^{-1}\tilde{X}
\end{equation}

This is the payoff for $Gen-0$ at $1^{-}$.

It's expected value when $Gen-0$ invested in period 0 was:

\begin{equation}
    E_0(\tilde{P_1}) = \beta^{-1} E_0(\tilde{X})
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \tilde{P_1} = \frac{P_1}{P_0} \\
    = R_1
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    E_0(\tilde{P_1}) = \frac{E_0(P_1)}{P_0} \\
    = E_0(R_1)
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

So the unexpected change in price 
for the $Gen-0$ $\tilde{P_1} - E_0(\tilde{P_1})$ is in fact
the unexpected return $R_1 - E_0(R_1)$:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \tilde{P_1} - E_0(\tilde{P_1}) = R_1 - E_0(R_1) \\
    = \beta^{-1} (\tilde{X} - E_0(\tilde{X})) \\
    = \beta^{-1} (\beta_m \tilde{M} + \beta_{cc} \tilde{CC} + \varepsilon_1)
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
