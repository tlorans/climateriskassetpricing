\chapter{Climate Risk}


Let $\tilde{C}_1$ denote climate at time 1, which is unknown at
time 0. The investor utility function is now:

\begin{equation}
    V(\tilde{W}_{1,i}, X_i, \tilde{C}_1) = \exp{(-A_i \tilde{W}_{1,i} - b_i^T X_i - c_i \tilde{C}_1})
\end{equation}

We have $\bar{c} := \int_i \omega_i c_i di$, 
the wealth-weighted mean of climate sensitivity across agents. 
We assume $\bar{c} > 0$, so that agents dislike low realizations of 
$\tilde{C}_1$, on average. We also assume $\tilde{C}_1$ is normally
distributed, and that $E(\tilde{C}_1) = 0$ and $Var(\tilde{C}_1) = 1$.

\section{Expected Returns}

\begin{equation}
    \mu = \mu_m \beta_m - \frac{\bar{d}}{a}g + \bar{c}(1 - \rho^2_{mC}) \psi 
\end{equation}

Expected returns depend on climate betas, $\psi$, which represent 
firms' exposures to non-market climate risk. A firm's climate 
beta is its loading on $\tilde{C}_1$ after controlling for the market return.
