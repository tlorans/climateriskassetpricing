PREDICTABILITY EXPLANATIONS HERE

This paper constructs portfolios with unexpected returns 
that are maximally correlated with unexpected components 
of future $y$. Specifically, the target variable is \textit{news}
about $y_{t+k}$, where $y_{t+k}$ is a macroeconomic variable
in period $t+k$. 

News is innovation in expectations about $y_{t+k}$, with 
notations:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta E_t(y_{t+k}) = E_t(y_{t+k}) - E_{t-1}(y_{t+k})
\end{equation}

For example, $\Delta E_t(y_{t+k})$ can be the news the market 
learns in July 2021 about the GDP growth rate in 2022.

The tracking portfolio returns are: 
\begin{equation}
    r_{t-1,t} = bR_{t-1,t}
\end{equation}

where $r_{t-1,t}$ is the return of the tracking portfolio,
$R{t-1,t}$ is a column vector of asset returns from the end 
of period $t-1$ to the end of period $t$, and $b$ is a row 
vector of portfolio weights.

The tracking portfolio is constructed using unexpected returns 
on the base assets. The unexpected returns are actual returns 
minus expected returns:

\begin{equation}
    \tilde{R}_{t-1,t} = R_{t-1,t} - E_{t-1}(R_{t-1,t})
\end{equation}

The portfolio weights are chosen so that $\tilde{r}_{t-1,t}$
is maximally correlated with $\Delta E_t(y_{t+k})$.

Estimating tracking portfolios for news is only slightly 
more complicated than estimating simple tracking portfolios. 
One can always write a projection equation of news on 
unexpected returns. The key assumption in this paper 
is that innovations in returns reflect innovations in 
expectations about future variables, so that the vector $a$
has non-zero elements in the projection equation:

\begin{equation}
    \Delta E_t(y_{t+k}) = a\tilde{R}_{t-1,t} + \eta_t
\end{equation}

where $\eta_t$ is the component of news that is orthogonal
to the unexpected returns. Since unexpected returns reflect
news about future cash flows and discount rates, $a$
will generally be non-zero for any variable correlated 
with future cash flows or discount rates (there is no 
intercept in the equation above).

It seems at first glance that one needs to obtain $\Delta E_t(y_{t+k})$,
the period $t$ news about $y_{t+k}$, to run the regression.
In fact, all that is needed is $\tilde{R}_{t-1,t}$, the
unexpected returns. The realization of $y_{t+k}$ 
can be written as the sum of the expectation in period $t-1$,
the innovation in expectations in period $t$, and the
innovation in expectations from period $t$ to period $t+k$:

\begin{equation}
    y_{t+k} = E_{t}(y_{t+k}) + e_{t,t+k} = E_{t-1}(y_{t+k}) + \Delta E_t(y_{t+k}) + e_{t,t+k}
\end{equation}

The second assumption made here is that expected returns 
on the base assets in period $t$ are linear functions 
of $Z_{t-1}$, a vector of control variables known at 
period $t-1$:

\begin{equation}
    E_t(R_{t-1,t}) = d Z_{t-1}
\end{equation}
