\chapter{Factor Mimicking Portfolios}


Ross (1976) \cite{ross1976apt} introduced 
the concept of \textit{arbitrage pricing theory} (APT).
In this model, the expected return of an asset is
a linear function of a set of risk factors. Famous examples of risk factors are the
\textit{Fama-French factors} (see Fama and French (1993) \cite{fama1993common}).
Those factors are the excess return of the market,
the excess return of small cap stocks over big cap stocks
and the excess return of high book-to-market stocks over low book-to-market stocks:

\begin{equation}
    E(R_i) = \beta_m R_m + \beta_{smb} R_{smb} + \beta_{hml} R_{hml}
\end{equation}

with $E(R_i)$ the expected return of asset $i$,
$R_m$ the excess return of the market, $R_{smb}$ the excess return of small cap stocks over big cap stocks,
$R_{hml}$ the excess return of high book-to-market stocks over low book-to-market stocks,
$\beta_m$ the market beta of asset $i$, $\beta_{smb}$ the size beta of asset $i$ and $\beta_{hml}$ the value beta of asset $i$.
Those factors are tradable, as 
they are directly traded in financial markets (you can buy 
the market, small cap stocks and high book-to-market stocks
and short sell the opposite side of the trade).

Macroeconomic factors are examples of 
\textit{non-tradable factors} (think about inflation, 
industrial growth, \textit{etc}). Economic conditions 
have pervasive effects on asset returns (see Flannery 
and Protopapadakis (2002) \cite{flannery2002macroeconomic}).
A standard way to tackle the problem of non-tradable factors
is to use factor mimicking portfolios (FMPs), such 
as in Jurczenko and Teiletche (2022) \cite{jurczenko2022macro}. That is,
to construct a portfolio of tradable assets that
mimics the behavior of non-tradable factors. 


Climate risks are non-tradable factors,
as they are not directly traded in financial markets
(see Jurczenko and Teiletche (2023) \cite{jurczenko2023climate}).
We can use the same approach of FMPs to construct
a portfolio of tradable assets that mimics the behavior
of climate risks.

\section{Climate News}


\subsection{Climate Risks}

A first step is to identify the factors of climate risks.
If we go back to the example of macroeconomic factors 
as non-tradable factors, we can think about expectations 
of inflation, industrial growth, \textit{etc}. 
Why a non-tradable factor could have an impact on asset prices?

To get an intuition, we can start from the definition of 
returns in a one period  (\textit{ie.} asset lasts only one period):

\begin{equation}
    R_{t+1} = \frac{D_{t+1}}{P_t}
\end{equation}

with $R_{t+1}$ the return of the asset from time $t$ to time $t+1$, 
$D_{t+1}$ the dividend paid at time $t+1$ 
and $P_t$ the price of the asset at time $t$.
There is no $P_{t+1}$ in the equation, 
as we are in a one period model and 
the stock doesn't exist anymore at time $t+1$. Take the expectations:

\begin{equation}
    E_t(R_{t+1}) = \frac{E_t(D_{t+1})}{P_t}
\end{equation}

And solve for $P_t$:

\begin{equation}
    P_t = \frac{E_t(D_{t+1})}{E_t(R_{t+1})}
\end{equation}

These formula 
represents the price of the asset at time $t$ 
as the discounted value of future dividends.
Dividends are used as a proxy for future cash flows.
The idea is: asset prices are determined by
expectations of future cash flows or discount rate.
Therefore, if a non-tradable factor affects
expectations of future cash flows or discount rate,
it will have an impact on asset prices.

The idea is quite immediately intuitive for macro factors:
it is easy to see how industrial growth
could affect expectations about cash flows or discount rate. 
But what about climate risks?





\subsection{Measuring Climate Risks}

For non-tradable factors such as macro factors, 
creating a time series that capture expectations 
of these factors is not so difficult. You may 
use data from the central bank, the government,
\textit{etc}. They publish leading indicators,
surveys, \textit{etc}. The task is more 
challenging for climate risks.

A common approach in the literature (see Engle et al. (2020) \cite{engle2020hedging})
is to use newspapers coverage of climate events as a proxy 
for the average investor's beliefs about climate risks.
As they noted, when there are events that plausibly
contains information about changes in climate risk,
this will likely leads to newspaper coverage of these events.
Newspapers may even be the direct source that investors
use to update their beliefs about climate risk.

\subsection{Innovation in Climate Risks}

Now what drives the changes in asset prices?
The changes in expectations about 
future cash flows or discount rate! So,
we are not so much interested in the level of
expectations of climate risks, but in the changes
in beliefs about climate risks.


We have a vector of $K$ \textit{non-tradable} factors $F_{t+h}$, with $h$ the 
forecast horizon. 
Investors form expectations of these factors 
adjust their expectations through time, based on new information or 
"surprise":

\begin{equation}
    \tilde{F}_{t+h} = F_{t+h} - \phi
\end{equation}

with $\phi$ the $K \times 1$ vector of expected factors.
$\tilde{F}_{t+h}$ is the \textit{innovation} in the factors of risks.




\section{Linear Factor Model with Climate News}


\subsection{Climate News and Unexpected Returns}

On the other hand, we have the \textit{unexpected} returns $\tilde{R}_t$:

\begin{equation}
    \tilde{R}_t = R_t - \mu
\end{equation}

The main assumption behind factor mimicking portfolios is that the innovation 
$\tilde{F_{t+h}}$ is reflected in the unexpected returns $\tilde{R}_t$:

\begin{equation}
    \tilde{R}_t = B \tilde{F}_{t+h} + \varepsilon_t
\end{equation}
    
where $B$ is a $N \times K$ matrix of factor loadings, $\varepsilon_t$ is a $N \times 1$ vector of mean zero disturbances.

It means that investors reprice assets (unexpected returns $\tilde{R}_t$) based on the arrival of new information on the factors of risks (innovation $\tilde{F}_{t+h}$).


\subsection{Factor Model with Climate News}

If:

\begin{equation}
    R_t = \mu + \tilde{R}_t
\end{equation}

Then, substituting $\tilde{R}_t$, we have the following factor model:

\begin{equation}
    R_t = \mu + B \tilde{F}_{t+h} + \varepsilon_t
\end{equation}

with $R_t$ a $N \times 1$ vector of 
asset returns, $\mu$ a $N \times 1$ vector
of expected returns, $B$ a $N \times K$ matrix
of factor loadings, $F_{t+h}$ a $K \times 1$ vector
of factor innovations and $\varepsilon_t$ a $N \times 1$
vector of mean zero disturbances.



\section{Mimicking Climate News}

The vector of weights $w_k$ 
is the solution to the following optimization problem:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        & \underset{w_k}{\min}
        & &  \frac{1}{2} w_k^T \Sigma w_k \\
        & \text{subject to}
        & & B^T w_k = \beta_k
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $B$ is the $N \times K$ matrix of factor loadings, $\beta_k$ is the $K \times 1$ vector of factor exposures,
with the $k$-th element equal to 1 and the other elements equal to $\beta_{k,l}$, 
and $\Sigma$ is the $N \times N$ covariance matrix of asset returns.

We can form the Lagrangian:

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}(w_k, \lambda) = \frac{1}{2} w_k^T \Sigma w_k - \lambda_k^T (B^T w_k - \beta_k)
\end{equation}

where $\lambda_k$ is the $K \times 1$ vector of Lagrange multipliers.

The first order condition is:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial w_k} &= \Sigma w_k - B \lambda = 0 \\
        \Rightarrow w_k &= \Sigma^{-1} B \lambda_k
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Substituting $w_k$ in the constraint, we have:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        B^T w_k &= \beta_k \\
        B^T \Sigma^{-1} B \lambda_k &= \beta_k \\
        \Rightarrow \lambda_k &= (B^T \Sigma^{-1} B)^{-1} \beta_k
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Substituting $\lambda_k$ in $w_k$, we finally have 
the solution to the optimization problem:

\begin{equation}
    w_k^* = \Sigma^{-1} B (B^T \Sigma^{-1} B)^{-1} \beta_k
\end{equation}

Taking together all the $K$ factors, we have the matrix of weights $W$:

\begin{equation}
    W = \Sigma^{-1} B (B^T \Sigma^{-1} B)^{-1} B_K
\end{equation}

where $B_K$ is the $K \times K$ matrix with the $k$-th column equal to $\beta_k$ and the other columns equal to $\beta_{k,l}$.

\subsection{Climate Risk Premia}

Careful about conclusion on risk premia based 
on time average of returns on the hedging portfolio.

\section{Conclusion}

In what follows, we will focus 
on the case of climate risk factors.
First stage is to identify how to measure 
climate risk factors.
