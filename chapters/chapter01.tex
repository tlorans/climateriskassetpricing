\chapter{Climate Risks}

Before going straight 
on climate risks, we need to agree on 
the definition of \textit{risk} in Finance. Suppose 
that a stock return follows an AR(1) process:

\begin{equation}
    R_{t} = \phi R_ {t-1} + \varepsilon_{t}
\end{equation}

with $\varepsilon_{t}$ is a \textit{white noise} process,
like a coin flip: completely unpredictable.
We generaly consider 
that it is 
mean zero $E_t(\varepsilon_{t+1}) = E(\varepsilon_{t+1}) = 0$
and constant variance $\sigma_t(\varepsilon_{t+1}) = \sigma(\varepsilon_{t+1})= \sigma_{\varepsilon}^2$.
Such white noise is also unpredictable from its past:
the \textit{autocorrelation} $\text{Corr}(\varepsilon_{t},\varepsilon_{t+1})=0$.
Below is an example of such white noise process.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{../images/chapter01/unexpected_shocks.png}
    \caption{$\varepsilon_t$ with $\sigma_{\varepsilon} = 0.5$}
    \label{fig:fig01}
\end{figure}


The conditional expectation of the stock return is:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    E_t(R_{t+1}) = \phi R_t + E_t(\varepsilon_{t+1}) \\
    = \phi R_t
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

because $E_t(\varepsilon_{t+1}) = 0$.

The actual or \textit{realized} return will vary 
around this expectation. The unexpected return is:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    R_{t+1} - E_t(R_{t+1}) = \phi R_t + \varepsilon_{t+1} - \phi R_t \\
    = \varepsilon_{t+1}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

and conditional variance of the stock return is:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \sigma_t^2(R_{t+1}) = \sigma^2_t(\varepsilon_{t+1}) \\
    = \sigma_{\varepsilon}^2
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

due to the definition of the white noise 
process with constant variance, and the fact that
we already know $R_t$ at time $t$, so 
$\sigma_t^2(R_{t}) = 0$.

Risk is the unexpected in Finance. This 
is the fact that returns are not 
what we expected. Either higher or lower.
So, what matters is this $\varepsilon_{t+1}$ in 
our stock return process and its variance $\sigma_{\varepsilon}^2$.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{../images/chapter01/ar_1.png}
    \caption{Simulation with increasing 
    uncertainty ($\sigma_{\varepsilon}^2$) in an AR(1) process.}
    \label{fig:fig01}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:fig01} shows the stock return process
with increasing uncertainty $\sigma_{\varepsilon}^2$.
The more uncertain the process, the more
the realized returns will vary around the
expected returns. 

With this in mind, we can now move to the question 
of climate risks. 

\section{Climate Risks and Asset Prices}

With a simple one-period model, we can
show how climate change-related issues can add uncertainty
to asset prices (thus, risks).
We will consider two channels through which
climate change adds uncertainty: the cash-flows channel
and the discount rate channel.

\subsection{Cash-Flows Channel}

Let's define a payoff $X_{t+1}$ as the 
cash-flows provided to the investors per dollar invested in the stock at time $t$:

\begin{equation}
    X_{t+1} = \frac{CF_{t+1}}{P_t}
\end{equation}

Analysts form forecasts 
about the future cash-flows of the firm
based on information available at time $t$.
The expectations of the payoff
are a function of climate-related
conditions $CC_{t+1}$. $CC_{t+1}$ could represents 
any climate-related issues that may affect the
firm's cash-flows. But to make the things more 
concrete, we can think of $CC_{t+1}$ as 
a carbon tax. 
The expected payoff is then:

\begin{equation}
    E_t(X_{t+1}) = \beta_{cc} E_t(CC_{t+1})
\end{equation}

with $\beta_{cc}$ the sensitivities of 
the payoff to the carbon tax. Of course,
the payoff may also depend on other factors
like macroeconomic conditions. But 
for the sake of simplicity, we will focus
on the carbon tax example.
In order to forecast the future payoff, analysts 
needs to forecast future carbon tax
$E_t(CC_{t+1})$.

Suppose that the carbon tax $CC_{t+1}$ is an AR(1) process:

\begin{equation}
    CC_{t+1} = \phi CC_t + \tilde{CC}_{t+1}
\end{equation}

with $\tilde{CC}_{t+1}$ a white noise process
representing unexpected changes in the carbon tax.
Again, $E_t(\tilde{CC}_{t+1}) = 0$ and
$\sigma_t^2(\tilde{CC}_{t+1}) = \sigma_{\tilde{CC}}^2$.
The expected value of the carbon tax at time $t+1$ is:

\begin{equation}
    E_t(CC_{t+1}) = \phi CC_t
\end{equation}


\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{../images/chapter01/carbon_tax_simulations.png}
    \caption{Simulation of the carbon tax process.}
    \label{fig:carbon_tax}
\end{figure}

The analysts may for example think that the carbon 
tax is supposed to increase by 5\%.
For the sake of the illustration, 
we simulate the carbon tax process with
$\phi = 1.05$ and $\sigma_{\tilde{CC}}^2 = 0.25$
with 10 periods
in figure~\ref{fig:carbon_tax} shows the carbon tax process.



Due to the possibility of unanticipated changes 
to the carbon tax,
the realized payoff may also differ from the expected one:

\begin{equation}
    X_{t+1} - E_{t}(X_{t+1}) = \beta_{CC} \tilde{CC}_{t+1} + \varepsilon_{t+1}
\end{equation}

Depending on the sensitivity of the payoff to the carbon tax $\beta_{CC}$,
the unexpected payoff may be more or less volatile.
The sign of $X_{t+1} - E_{t}(X_{t+1})$ will depend on the sign of $\tilde{CC}_{t+1}$
and the sign of $\beta_{CC}$.

\subsection{Discount Rate Channel}

Now, how the stock is priced? 
The price of the stock is the discounted value of the 
cash-flows per dollar invested in the stock.
The cash-flows are discounted according 
to a required rate of return for the firm:

\begin{equation}
    P_{t+1} = \frac{X_{t+1}}{\rho_{t+1}}
\end{equation}

If we assume that $\beta_m = 0$,
we have a time-varying discount rate $\rho_{t+1}$:

\begin{equation}
    \rho_{t+1} = 1 - \frac{\beta_{CC}}{\gamma} d_{t+1}
\end{equation}

with $d_{t+1}$ the perception of climate 
risks by the average investor at time $t+1$,
and $\gamma$ the constant risk aversion of 
the average investor.

The price in $P_{t+1}$, once 
the shock are realized at time $t+1$, will be:

\begin{equation}
    P_{t+1} = \frac{X_{t+1}}{1 - \frac{\beta_{CC}}{\gamma}d_{t+1}}
\end{equation}

Which can be approximated as:

\begin{equation}
    P_{t+1} \approx X_{t+1} + \frac{\beta_{CC}}{\gamma}d_{t+1}
\end{equation}

It's expected value at time $t$ is:

\begin{equation}
    E_t(P_{t+1}) = E_t(X_{t+1}) + \frac{\beta_{CC}}{\gamma}E_t(d_{t+1})
\end{equation}

And the unexpected return is:

\begin{equation}
    R_{t+1} - E_t(R_{t+1}) = P_{t+1} - E_t(P_{t+1})
\end{equation}

because $X_{t+1}$ is the payoff per dollar invested in the stock at time $t$,
which corresponds to the definition of a return in a 
one-period model $R_{t+1} = \frac{CF_{t+1}}{P_t}$.

We now can substitute $P_{t+1}$ and $E_t(P_{t+1})$ in the equation above:

\begin{equation}
    R_{t+1} - E_t(R_{t+1}) = X_{t+1} + \frac{\beta_{CC}}{\gamma}d_{t+1} - E_t(X_{t+1}) - \frac{\beta_{CC}}{\gamma}E_t(d_{t+1})
\end{equation}

We recognize the unexpected payoff $X_{t+1} - E_t(X_{t+1})$:

\begin{equation}
    R_{t+1} - E_t(R_{t+1}) = X_{t+1} - E_t(X_{t+1}) + \frac{\beta_{CC}}{\gamma}d_{t+1} - \frac{\beta_{CC}}{\gamma}E_t(d_{t+1})
\end{equation}

We can rewrite the unexpected payoff as a function of the shocks:

\begin{equation}
    R_{t+1} - E_t(R_{t+1}) = \beta_m \tilde{M}_{t+1} + \beta_{CC} \tilde{CC}_{t+1} + \varepsilon_{t+1} + \frac{\beta_{CC}}{\gamma}d_{t+1} - \frac{\beta_{CC}}{\gamma}E_t(d_{t+1})
\end{equation}

Let's drop the macroeconomic component as 
we assumed that $\beta_m = 0$:

\begin{equation}
    R_{t+1} - E_t(R_{t+1}) = \beta_{CC} \tilde{CC}_{t+1} + \varepsilon_{t+1} + \frac{\beta_{CC}}{\gamma}d_{t+1} - \frac{\beta_{CC}}{\gamma}E_t(d_{t+1})
\end{equation}

We can factorize the second part, with
the unexpected change in the average perception of climate risks $d$:

\begin{equation}
    R_{t+1} - E_t(R_{t+1}) = \beta_{CC} \tilde{CC}_{t+1} + \varepsilon_{t+1} + \frac{\beta_{CC}}{\gamma}(d_{t+1} - E_t(d_{t+1}))
\end{equation}

We group together the terms related to the climate change:

\begin{equation}
    R_{t+1} - E_t(R_{t+1}) = \beta_{CC} \tilde{CC}_{t+1} + \varepsilon_{t+1} + \beta_{CC} \left( \frac{1}{\gamma}(d_{t+1} - E_t(d_{t+1})) \right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    R_{t+1} - E_t(R_{t+1}) = \beta_{CC} \left(\tilde{CC}_{t+1} + \frac{1}{\gamma}(d_{t+1} - E_t(d_{t+1})) \right) + \varepsilon_{t+1}
\end{equation}

What does it says? In our simple model, 
we have related the unexpected returns to the
unexpected changes in climate risks. It can 
either comes from the realization of an 
unexpected climate event $\tilde{CC}_{t+1}$,
or from the unexpected change in the average
perception of climate risks $d_{t+1} - E_t(d_{t+1})$.



Now what drives the changes in asset prices?
Ultimately, we are interested in the changes in asset prices,
source of potential \textit{returns}.
The changes in expectations about 
future cash flows or discount rate. 
So,
we are not so much interested in the level of
expectations of climate risks, but in the changes
in beliefs about climate risks.

Investors form expectations about climate risks
in an horizon $h$ with information available (those 
are conditional expectations).
Each period, new information arrives and investors
update their beliefs about climate risks:

\begin{equation}
    \Delta E_t (CC_{t+h}) = E_t(CC_{t+h}) - E_{t-1}(CC_{t+h})
\end{equation}

with $\Delta E_t (CC_{t+h})$ the \textit{innovation} or 
\textit{news} in climate risk. On the other hand, we have the \textit{unexpected} returns $\tilde{R}_t$:

\begin{equation}
    \tilde{R}_t = R_t - E_{t-1}(R_t)
\end{equation}

with $R_t$ the \textit{realized} returns 
and $E_{t-1}(R_t)$ the expected returns based on information available at time $t-1$.
Because investors reprice assets based on the arrival of new information,
we can expect that the innovation in climate risk is reflected in the unexpected returns:

\begin{equation}
    \tilde{R}_t = \beta \Delta E_t(CC_{t+h}) + \varepsilon_t
\end{equation}


with $\beta$ non-null as long as we expect 
that changes in climate risks affect investors 
expectations about future cash flows or discount rate.


\section{Measuring Climate Risks}

We have seen that what matters for asset prices
are expectations about climate risks. What 
matters about returns are the changes in
expectations about climate risks.

For more traditional macroeconomic factors, 
creating a time series that capture expectations 
of these factors is not so difficult. You may 
use data from the central bank, the government,
\textit{etc}. They publish leading indicators,
surveys, \textit{etc}. The task is more 
challenging for climate risks.

A common approach in the literature (see Engle et al. (2020) \cite{engle2020hedging})
is to use newspapers coverage of climate events as a proxy 
for the average investor's beliefs about climate risks.
As they noted, when there are events that plausibly
contains information about changes in climate risk,
this will likely leads to newspaper coverage of these events.
Newspapers may even be the direct source that investors
use to update their beliefs about climate risk.
Following the initial work from Engle et al. (2020) \cite{engle2020hedging},
researchers have developed a number of climate 
news series series capturing a variety of different climate risks.
Each measure is signed such that a large number 
corresponds to "bad news".
