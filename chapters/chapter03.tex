\chapter{Hedging Climate Risk 
for a Fund}

An investor might be seeking to hedge 
the climate risks to improve 
the risk-return profile of a portfolio.

\section{Hedging a Portfolio with FMPs}

A practical way to would be to determine 
a combination of an existing portfolio $p$ with,
climate FMPs that minimizes the variance of 
the combined portfolio returns.

More precisely, let's assume that the 
investors determines a vector "tilt" 
$\omega$ that represents the weights of
the FMPs in the combined portfolio.

The vector $\omega$ would be determined by:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        & \underset{\omega}{\min}
        & &   T^{-1} \sum^T_{t=1} (R^p_t - \omega^T FMP_t)^2\\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
