\section{Risk Mimicking Portfolio}

The mimicking portfolio approach combines a pre-determined set of 
assets into a portfolio that is maximally correlated with a given 
climate change shock, using historical data. To obtain the mimicking
portfolios, we estimate the following regression model:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:regression}
    CC_t = w R_t + \epsilon_t
\end{equation}

where $CC_t$ denotes the (mean zero) climate hedge target in month $t$,
$w$ is a vector of $N$ portfolio weights, $R_t$ is the $N \times 1$ vector 
of unexpected excess returns and $\epsilon_t$ is the regression residual.
The portfolio weights are estimated each month using a rolling window of
$T$ months of historical data.
